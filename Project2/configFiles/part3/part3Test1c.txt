# CONFIG FILE FOR PATHBUILDER PROJECT PART 3 TESTING
# Blank lines are ignored.  Lines beginning with # are ignored.
# All other lines are processed.

# !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
# NOTE: THIS CONFIG FILE SHOULD NOT BE MODIFIED.
# THE PARAMETERS AND CORRESPONDING RESULT ARE A SPECIFIC
# TEST PROVIDED FOR YOU TO CHECK YOUR PART 3 SOLUTION.
# !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

# This config file format is intended for use with
# Part3Test.java.

# NOTE: the GUI is not used for part 3 testing.

# NOTE: PLAYERS is not used in PART 3 config file.  The player
# to be tested is instead provided via a command line argument
# when running the program.  Also, TIMELIMIT is not specified
# in the config file, but internally a 10 second limit
# is used to limit the allowed computation by the player
# for any method call.

# PART must be present with value 3 to indicate that this
# file is appropriate for PART 3 testing
PART 3

# DIM is used to indicate the size of the smaller dimension
# of the grid of nodes for each player.
# It must have an integer value in the range 3-20.
# The larger dimension always has value DIM+1.
# Both players nodes can be placed on an overall grid of
# size (2*DIM+1) by (2*DIM+1).
# DIM has a default value of 6 if it is not specified in
# the configuration file.
DIM 3

# a PREMOVE is used to get the game started with
# a specific move before calling the
# HUMAN / player modules for moves.
# a PREMOVE must have three comma-separated values,
# with no spaces, indicating row, column and player id
# for the move.
# Multiple PREMOVE lines are allowed, and are processed in order.
# An invalid PREMOVE will cause a game error.
# PREMOVE lines are optional.

# ID is used to indicate which player is being
# queried.  It must have value 1 or 2.  It indicates
# which player is checked for winnability.
ID 2

# MOVES is used to indicate how many total moves
# maximum are allowed before the queried player
# must be able to guarantee victory.  The player
# to go next is determined by the premoves.  If
# there are no specified premoves, player 1 gets
# the first of these moves.  Otherwise, it is
# the player who didn't make the last premove.
# MOVES must have a value greater than or equal to 0.
MOVES 8

# RESULT for part 3 contains a single boolean value.
# This is a groundtruth value for this test indicating
# whether the specified player can win in the
# given number of total moves
RESULT false

# COMMENT----------------------------------------------
# this is really the only example where we can
# computationally show that player 1 can win the
# game from the starting position.  DIM 3 and 9
# moves will get the job done. (7 moves is not enough.)
