# CONFIG FILE FOR PATHBUILDER PROJECT PART 3 TESTING
# Blank lines are ignored.  Lines beginning with # are ignored.
# All other lines are processed.

# !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
# NOTE: THIS CONFIG FILE SHOULD NOT BE MODIFIED.
# THE PARAMETERS AND CORRESPONDING RESULT ARE A SPECIFIC
# TEST PROVIDED FOR YOU TO CHECK YOUR PART 3 SOLUTION.
# !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

# This config file format is intended for use with
# Part3Test.java.

# NOTE: the GUI is not used for part 3 testing.

# NOTE: PLAYERS is not used in PART 3 config file.  The player
# to be tested is instead provided via a command line argument
# when running the program.  Also, TIMELIMIT is not specified
# in the config file, but internally a 10 second limit
# is used to limit the allowed computation by the player
# for any method call.

# PART must be present with value 3 to indicate that this
# file is appropriate for PART 3 testing
PART 3

# DIM is used to indicate the size of the smaller dimension
# of the grid of nodes for each player.
# It must have an integer value in the range 3-20.
# The larger dimension always has value DIM+1.
# Both players nodes can be placed on an overall grid of
# size (2*DIM+1) by (2*DIM+1).
# DIM has a default value of 6 if it is not specified in
# the configuration file.
DIM 4

# a PREMOVE is used to get the game started with
# a specific move before calling the
# HUMAN / player modules for moves.
# a PREMOVE must have three comma-separated values,
# with no spaces, indicating row, column and player id
# for the move.
# Multiple PREMOVE lines are allowed, and are processed in order.
# An invalid PREMOVE will cause a game error.
# PREMOVE lines are optional.
PREMOVE 7,7,1
PREMOVE 6,2,2
PREMOVE 4,2,1
PREMOVE 7,3,2
PREMOVE 4,6,1
PREMOVE 1,1,2
PREMOVE 3,3,1
PREMOVE 1,7,2
PREMOVE 5,1,1
PREMOVE 3,5,2
PREMOVE 7,1,1
PREMOVE 3,1,2
PREMOVE 2,2,1
PREMOVE 5,5,2

# ID is used to indicate which player is being
# queried.  It must have value 1 or 2.  It indicates
# which player is checked for winnability.
ID 2

# MOVES is used to indicate how many total moves
# maximum are allowed before the queried player
# must be able to guarantee victory.  The player
# to go next is determined by the premoves.  If
# there are no specified premoves, player 1 gets
# the first of these moves.  Otherwise, it is
# the player who didn't make the last premove.
# MOVES must have a value greater than or equal to 0.
MOVES 4

# RESULT for part 3 contains a single boolean value.
# This is a groundtruth value for this test indicating
# whether the specified player can win in the
# given number of total moves
RESULT true

# COMMENT----------------------------------------------
# In this case, it is player1's turn, but player2
# has a winning position.  Both at the top and the
# bottom, player2 has two edges to connect to that
# side of the board.  Player1 can't block both.
# Test8a shows that player2 can guarantee win in 4 total moves.
# Test8b shows that player2 can not guarantee win in 2 total moves.
# Test8c shows that player1 can not guarantee win in 3 total moves.
